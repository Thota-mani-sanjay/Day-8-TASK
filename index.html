    <p><li>The Allbirds Approach Wear-All-Day Comfort Lightweight, bouncy, and wildly comfortable, Allbirds shoes make any outing feel effortless. Slip in, lace up, or slide them on and enjoy the comfy support.Sustainability In Every Step From materials to transport, we’re working to reduce our carbon footprint to near zero. Holding ourselves accountable and striving for climate goals isn’t a 30-year goal—it’s now.Materials From The Earth We replace petroleum-based synthetics with natural alternatives wherever we can. Like using wool, tree fiber, and sugar cane. They’re soft, breathable, and better for the planet—win, win, win.</li></p>
    <p><li>The fashion industry dumps 2.1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. That's equal to the pollution from 456,707,817 cars in the same timeframe. Why so much? Because our industry loves fossil fuels—to power factories, ship things, and make materials. In other words, most of what we wear is made from plastic, and plastic comes from oil, a fossil fuel.</li></p>
    <p><li>Climate change is a complex topic. Which is why we’re focused on what we can control: driving our emissions to zero. We do this with a data-driven approach, investing in projects, systems, and tools that maximize our potential for positive impact. Today, we have a three-part approach to address our climate impact: we measure our emissions, reduce our footprint, and work to support the removal of carbon emissions from the atmosphere.</li></p>
    <p><li>We think doing better means doing more than measuring and mitigating our impact. So we’re focused on strategies that will reduce our footprint, with a focus on actions in our value chain.</li></p>
    <p><li>We get it—talk is cheap. And lately, it seems like there’s a lot of it, without much action. Which is why we’re focused on 2025 and committing to a five-year to-do list—goals that will let you hold us accountable.</li></p>
